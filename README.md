# About
Gadget master uses a webscraping script that traverses through the URLs of the Leading UK supermarkits stored in the database. It then scrapes the prices from the website pages and updates the database with the latest prices. As it currently stands users can register to create an account and store items in a basket, there is not a checkout page yet.
